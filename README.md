Learning is practicing.
This repository contains my first steps in the world of programming. I did many exercises in programming logic and algorithms, as I believe in the extreme importance of practicing what I learn. Otherwise, all study and effort would be in vain and lost in time.
You only learn to ride a bicycle by riding it and pedaling.
